Description:  

Scripting for the data science pipeline. Acquiring, accessing, and transforming data in the 
forms of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data.  

Additional Course Description:    

The goal of this class is to teach students the tools and skills of scripting needed to solve 
problems of accessing and preparing data in a variety of formats and situations, sometimes 
known as data wrangling. The scripting will provide the skills needed to form data science 
pipelines, from acquiring and cleaning data to accessing data and transforming data for analysis 
or visualization.   

The main content focus is on information access and processing tasks on the types of 
structured, semistructured, and unstructured data in current use in information applications. For 
these three types of data, the course includes the use of structured numeric and text data such 
as that from a spreadsheet or database, the use of data obtained through standard data 
exchange formats such as HTML or XML from web pages or JSON from web-based APIs, and 
the use of data obtained by pattern matching from text or log files. The scripting language 
Python was chosen because of its ease of use and available packages to work with data in 
many information applications. The skills learned in this class are intended to complement the 
analytical and visualization skills learned in other data science courses. The scripting language 
Python will be taught, but it will be assumed that students already have a programming 
background, either through course work or through online study.  

Prerequisite / Co-requisite:   

 For graduate students, no specific course is required, but some programming knowledge 
will be assumed. This may be acquired through courses or online resources.  

Credits:  

 3.0  
Learning Objectives:  

 Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to  

 write scripts to access and amass data from fields in structured data, access fields in 
semistructured data, and define and find patterns of data in unstructured data;  

prepare and transform data to produce data summaries, lists, and networks;

Other readings will be assigned from online resources.  

Course Requirements and Expectations:  

Class sessions are designed around developing solutions for the main focus application tasks. 
Each section of the course contains a smaller number of daily problems that lead up to focus on 
one overall application design challenge in each of the three types of data. The instructor will 
then demonstrate how to solve an example of the design challenge, and then students will be 
asked to solve a similar problem. The design challenges will focus on the use of structured 
numeric and text data such as that from a spreadsheet or database, the use of data obtained 
through standard data exchange formats such as HTML or XML from web pages or JSON from 
web-based APIs, and the use of data obtained by pattern matching from text or log files.   

The coursework will consist mainly of small weekly lab programming and analysis problems, 
three larger design and programming problems for homework, and the final project. There will 
also be two quizzes, where half the quiz will be multiple choice questions and the other half will 
be programming questions. The class attendance and participation grade include both 
asynchronous (completing asynchronous exercises) AND live session attendance and 
participation. The final project will require an additional report on a data science analysis 
question appropriate for the problem data.

University Attendance Policy  

Attendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. Students are expected 
to arrive on campus in time to attend the first meeting of all classes for which they are 
registered. Students who do not attend classes starting with the first scheduled meeting may be 
academically withdrawn as not making progress toward degree by failure to attend. Instructors 
set course-specific policies for absences from scheduled class meetings in their syllabi. It is a 
federal requirement that students who do not attend or cease to attend a class to be reported at 
the time of determination by the faculty. Students should also review the university’s religious 
observance policy and make the required arrangements at the beginning of each semester.

Course Specific Policies on attendance, late work, and make up work  

Attendance is required and cannot be made up except for excused absences for illness and for 
other school-sanctioned activities. For assignments, late work will be accepted but will be 
penalized with the points equivalent to ½ of a letter grade for one day late and on a sliding scale 
for additional lateness of up to a full letter grade.  

Syracuse University Policies:   

Students should review the University’s policies regarding: Diversity and Disability  
https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/;  the Religious Observances Notification and 
Policy http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm; and Orange SUccess - 
http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/.  

Disability-Related Accommodations  

Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual 
respect and full participation. If you believe that you need academic adjustments  
(accommodations) for a disability, please contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS), visit 
the ODS website– http://disabilityservices.syr.edu, located in Room 309 of 804 University 
Avenue, or call (315) 443-4498 or TDD: (315) 443-1371 for an appointment to discuss your 
needs and the process for requesting academic adjustments. ODS is responsible for 
coordinating disability-related academic adjustments and will issue students with documented 
Disabilities Accommodation Authorization Letters, as appropriate. Since academic adjustments 
may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as 
soon as possible. Our goal at the iSchool is to create learning environments that are useable, 
equitable, inclusive and welcoming. If there are aspects of the instruction or design of this 
course that result in barriers to your inclusion or accurate assessment or achievement, please 
meet with me to discuss additional strategies beyond official accommodations that may be 
helpful to your success.  

Academic Integrity Policy  

Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university 
community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for 
academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. 

  
   
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
COURSE SYLLABUS   
IST652 – Scripting for Data Analysis

______________________________________________________________________  
Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific 
expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy 
governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and 
assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of 
participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work 
in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. 
Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the 
course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the 
course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. SU students 
are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and 
provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check-in 
on MySlice. For more information about the policy, see 
http://class.syr.edu/academicintegrity/policy/.  

The Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric establishes recommended guidelines for the 
determination of grade penalties by faculty and instructors, while also giving them discretion to 
select the grade penalty they believe most suitable, including course failure, regardless of 
violation level. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of 
violation level.  

Course Specific Policy on the Use of Turnitin  

This class will use the plagiarism detection and prevention system Turnitin. I will submit all 
papers you write for this class to Turnitin, which compares submitted documents against 
documents on the Internet and against student papers submitted to Turnitin at SU and at other 
colleges and universities. I will take your knowledge of the subject matter of this course and 
your writing level and style into account in interpreting the originality report. Keep in mind that all 
papers you submit for this class will become part of the Turnitin.com reference database solely 
for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of such papers.  I will provide you a consent statement to 
sign, date and return to me that will state the following:  

“By signing below, I give permission for the submission of all work I turn in for  
Scripting for Data Analysis to the plagiarism detection and prevention system  
Turnitin, which compares submitted documents against documents on the 
Internet and against student papers submitted to Turnitin at SU and at other 
colleges and universities. I understand that all assignments submitted for this 
class will become part of the Turnitin.com reference database solely for the 
purpose of detecting plagiarism of such papers.”  

Educational Use of Student Work  

Student work prepared for University courses in any media may be used for educational 
purposes, if the course syllabus makes clear that such use may occur. You grant permission to

______________________________________________________________________  
have your work used in this manner by registering for, and by continuing to be enrolled in, 
courses where such use of student work is announced in the course syllabus.   

Discrimination or Harassment  

The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any 
protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, 
gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, 
religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, 
gender expression or perceived gender.  

Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should 
be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer. 
She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws including Titles VI, VII,  
IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, 
Inclusion, and Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 
132441120; by email: titleix@syr.edu; or by telephone: 315-443-0211.  

Federal and state law, and University policy prohibit discrimination and harassment based on 
sex or gender (including sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic/dating violence, stalking, 
sexual exploitation, and retaliation). If a student has been harassed or assaulted, they can 
obtain confidential counseling support, 24-hours a day, 7 days a week, from the Sexual and 
Relationship Violence Response Team at the Counseling Center (315-443-4715, 200 Walnut 
Place, Syracuse, New York 13244-5040). Incidents of sexual violence or harassment can be 
reported non-confidentially to the University’s Title IX Officer (Sheila Johnson Willis, 315-
4430211, titleix@syr.edu, 005 Steele Hall). Reports to law enforcement can be made to the  
University’s Department of Public Safety (315-443-2224, 005 Sims Hall), the Syracuse Police  
Department (511 South State Street, Syracuse, New York, 911 in case of emergency or 
315435-3016 to speak with the Abused Persons Unit), or the State Police (844-845-7269). I will 
seek to keep information you share with me private to the greatest extent possible, but as a 
professor I have mandatory reporting responsibilities to share information regarding sexual 
misconduct, harassment, and crimes I learn about to help make our campus a safer place for 
all.  

School Library Media Program Assessment  

The School Library Media Program is accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator 
Preparation (CAEP) through the Syracuse University School of Education. As a part of that 
accreditation, the School Library Media Program must assess student performance on the 
competencies that correlate to program outcomes. The competencies which are assessed are 
identical to the items on your Competency Checklist.  As a part of School Library Media 
Program planning, course-embedded assessments have been aligned with student 
competencies. For CAEP reporting, each faculty member with competency-based, course-
embedded assessments is asked to rate (1=Ineffective, 2=Developing, 3=Effective or 4=Highly 
Effective) candidates’ performance on the respective competencies. This is the same rating

______________________________________________________________________  
scale students use when completing the competency checklist. Scoring is conducted for key 
assignments and not all assignments for a course.  

What this means for you:  
Your individual score is NOT a grade and it is part of an aggregate report. If a student is 
performing at an Ineffective or Developing level, a comment is submitted with the score, which 
is also aggregated. Individual scores and comments are not associated with specific student 
names.  

 Course evaluations:    

 There will be an end of course evaluation for you to complete this term. This evaluation will be 
conducted online and is entirely anonymous. You will receive a notification from the Syracuse 
University Office of Institutional Research & Assessment (OIRA) department in your email 
account with the evaluation website link and your passcode. Please take the time and fill out 
this evaluation as your feedback and support of this assessment effort is very much 
appreciated.  The school carefully reviews ratings and comments that you submit, and these 
factor into decisions about course, program and instructor development.

LAB PROBLEMS  

ONE:   

For the NBAfile.py program, for each line, create a string using string formatting that puts the 
team, attendance, and ticket prices into a formatted string. Each line should look something like:   

‘The attendance at Atlanta was 13993 and the ticket price was $20.06’   

Your program should then print these strings instead of the lines. Submit your code and the 
output of your program. Submit assignment as a .txt, .py, .pdf, or jupyter notebook file. 

DUE 24 hours before the live session in Week 3.   

TWO:   

Dictionaries: You may wish to write the code for parts a–d in one Python file.   

Consider the following two dictionaries:   

stock = {"banana": 6, "apple": 0, "orange": 32, "pear": 15}   

prices = {"banana": 4, "apple": 2, "orange": 1.5, "pear": 3}   

a. Show the expression that gets the value of the stock dictionary at the key ‘orange’.  Show a 
statement that adds an item to the stock dictionary called ‘cherry’ with some integer value 
and that adds ‘cherry’ to the prices dictionary with a numeric value. (Or pick your own fruit 
name.)   

b. Write the code for a loop that iterates over the stock dictionary and prints each key and value.   

c. Suppose that we have a list:   

groceries = [‘apple’, ‘banana’, ‘pear’]   

Write the code that will sum the total number in stock of the items in the groceries list.   

d. Write the code that can print out the total value in stock of all the items. This program can 

iterate over the stock dictionary and for each item multiply the number in stock times the price 
of that item in the prices dictionary. (This can include the items for ‘cherry’ or not, as you 
choose.)   

Submit your code and the output of your program. Submit assignment as a .txt, .py, .pdf, or 
jupyter notebook file.

Homework 1: Structured Data   

Due: 24 hours before the live session in Week 5   

You can choose to complete this assignment by yourself or with a group of at most two total 
participants. Each person must turn the assignment in for grading, and each person must 
contribute to the development of the program. Use the file Donors_Data.csv.   

Structured Data Processing   

For purposes of this writeup, we will use examples from the Donors data file.   
The main outline of your assignment is to write a program that will read in the data from a file, 
such as the .csv file saved from Excel. This will be in a format that is structured with lines of 
data representing one type of unit (i.e., one donor in the donors file). Your program will 
represent the data as Python data structures. You may choose for the overall structure to be 
one or both of the following:   

- A list of dictionaries, or some combination of lists, dictionaries, and NumPy arrays   

  
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
COURSE SYLLABUS   
IST652 – Scripting for Data Analysis  

13  
______________________________________________________________________  
- A pandas dataframe   

You will do data exploration and cleaning on this data.   

The program will do some processing to convert the data to a form that will answer at least two 
questions as described below, and write files with the data suitable for answering each question. 
Graphing is optional.   

Data:   

You may choose a data set to work with. As a guideline, data sets should have somewhere 
between 500 and 4,000 lines of data with some number of columns between 4 and 50. These 
guidelines are not exact limits, just guidance for selecting data.   
If the data comes in an Excel spreadsheet with a lot of columns, it is okay to first edit the file to 
remove columns that you do not need for your processing. For example, in the Donors data, you 
might wish to create a separate spreadsheet with only a few columns of data.   

Questions:   

For this assignment, at least one question that you choose to answer should look at the data in 
a different unit of analysis than is present in the data file. For example, instead of looking at 
individual donors, you could look at the donors of each of the nine income or wealth types.   

Simplest example question (you should do one more complex than this):   

For each wealth type, what is the average home value of all the donors of that type?   

- Unit of analysis: wealth types   

- Comparison: for each wealth type, compute the average home values of the neighborhoods of 

all the donors of that type   

- Output: should be in a file with nine rows of data (you may also produce header and label 

rows), where each row has an income type (1–9) and the average home values   

One way to increase the complexity of this particular question would be to add more items to be 
compared to the income types, e.g., add columns to the output with average total gifts or values 
of the last gifts. Another way is to introduce a more detailed unit of analysis; for example, 
suppose that for each income level you reported by gender, giving the average home value for 
both men and women in each category.   

Other ideas:   

Compare donors in the various zip codes with various types or amounts of giving.

14  
______________________________________________________________________  
Compare donors by the number of promotions with the total amount of donations and the 
frequency of donations.   

Compare the number of months since the last donation to the donation amounts.   

What to Submit:   

In addition to the program that you write, you should write a small report. In it you should 
provide:   

- Data and its source   

- Description of your data exploration and data cleaning steps   

- At least two clearly stated comparison questions with the unit of analysis, the comparison 

values, and how they are computed   

- Brief description of the program   

- Description of the output files and analysis of that output. 

- Final conclusion about the data and what your most important take away was.  

For your program, you may use any of the code developed in class as a template, but it is 
absolutely essential that you use appropriate variable names and that you write original 
comments for what your program does. Recall that good comments demonstrate your 
understanding of the code that you write and the problem that you are trying to solve.   

Group Work:   

If you choose to work in a group (of two), you may write and submit a single program, but you 
must process the data for two additional comparison questions. Each member of your group 
should write some part of the program, even if edited together later. Your report should describe 
the roles of the group members and who did what parts of the assignment, possibly including 
the data exploration, data cleaning, formulating questions to answer, and debugging.   

Submit the following in a single submission (for each person):   

- Report (A Word document or PDF file) 

• 

I must be able to find the data that you utilized (link to the website, etc.)   

- Program(s)  

•  Must be submitted as stand-alone Python or Jupyter Notebook files that I can execute on

Homework 2: Semistructured Data   

Due: 24 hours before the live session in Week 8   

For this homework assignment, you may work on your own or you may work in a group of two 
people.   

Semistructured Data Processing   

The main outline of your assignment is to write a program that will read in JSON formatted data 
from a Mongo DB collection or from a file. This will be in a format that is structured with lines of 
data representing one type of unit, for example, one tweet for Twitter or one post from  
Facebook. Your program will contain the data as lists of JSON structures, which are just Python 
dictionaries and lists. Your program may also contain pandas dataframes for processed data.   

The program will do some processing to collect data from some of the fields that will answer one 
or more questions as described below, and write a file with the data suitable for answering each 
question. Remember that some fields may be optional or have null values, so you may need to 
test for those conditions. Graphing is definitely optional.   

Questions:   

Process one collection of data and summarize information from a number of fields. This 

Types of questions:   
• 
is similar to the example programs for Twitter hashtags or Facebook counts but must access 
different and more fields than in those examples.   

Process one collection of data and separate it into different categories and give some 

• 
summary statistics on those categories. For example, bin the Tweets by day or by hour and 
report on the number of tweets per day or hour.   
• 
collections. For example, collect Twitter user timelines from different political candidates and 
compare the number of retweets of their tweets.   

Process two or more collections of data and compare some summary data about the two 

You may use the programs twitter_lang.py as an example, but you must use different fields. You 
may also use twitter_hashtags.py or facebook_counts.py, but in these programs you must add a 
part to write a file. In all cases, you must change the comments to reflect your individual 
understanding of the program. If you only do one question, then it must be more complex than 
these simple examples; otherwise, you may choose additional questions.  

Data:   

You may collect data from Twitter, Facebook, or some other URL that returns JSON data. (If 
you want to use another format, such as XML, please ask.) If you collect your own, please 
collect at least several hundred data items, if possible.

______________________________________________________________________  

You may request me to collect data for you, and if so, please make that request as soon as 
possible.   

What to Submit:   

1.  The program that you write,  

2.  A report in a Word Document or PDF File. In it provide:   

• The data and its source, including any preprocessing   

• A clearly stated question that describes whether it is a summary or comparison question 

and what fields are being used in the data   

• A brief description of the program   

• Description of the output files and analysis of that output. 

• Final conclusion about the data and what your most important take away was.  

3.  Output files (may be included in your jupyter notebook or your report) 

For your program, you may use any of the code developed in class as a template, but it is 
absolutely essential that you use appropriate variable names and that you write original 
comments for what your program does.   

Submit your report, your program and your output file(s).   

Group Work:   

If you choose to work in a group (of two), you may write and submit one program, but you must 
process the data for (at least) two comparison questions. Each member of the group should 
write some part of the program, even if edited later together. Your report should describe the 
roles of the group members and who did what parts of the project, possibly including data, 
formulating questions, and debugging.

Planning for the Project   

For this assignment, you are to make an initial plan for a project. In the final project you will 
demonstrate your ability to write Python scripts to access and amass data from fields in one or 
more of the three types of data studied in the course and to prepare and use data to produce 
data summaries, lists, and other structures.   

Choose whether to work individually or to work in a team of two or three people. If you 

1. 
wish to work in a team, specify the people that you have talked with to form a team.  

2. 
Pick a topic of investigation and the data that you will use, ideally from more than one 
source. The topic could focus on one main data set but also have supporting data. Your topic 
may focus on a single target topic or person, combinations of them, a comparison of more than 
one target topic and person, or comparisons over time.   

The data may come from any source: those that you have found online, collected from social 
media, or obtained through other means.   

3. 
Pick several possible methods of analysis in order to give some initial idea of what 
analysis you will try. This analysis will be to answer the types of questions that you have worked 
on for the homework assignments. Since we are not focused on visualization, the results of your 
analysis can be reported as structured tables with a unit of analysis and collected, summarized, 
or computed values for those units.   

The scale of the final project must be larger in scope than the homework assignments in at least 
one of the following dimensions:   

• Incorporating multiple data sets, possibly combining structured, semistructured, or text data   
• Conducting additional related analysis questions (either more complex questions or more 

questions)   

• Including additional types of analysis or collecting data, e.g., using another API or social 

network analysis   

4. If you know of places where you may need help with development, try to list that now.   

This can range from big things (I want to get information from FourSquare comments) to small 
things (I’d like a program that helps me to get dates from the documents in my collection and be 
able to compare dates).   

[Potential remaining topics: Social network analysis, geographic locations and maps, getting all 
Facebook comments. You may request to add to this list.]   

5. State in what way you intend for your project to be larger in scope than either of the 

homework assignments.

Assignment Result   

Hand in a short document with your initial project plan describing your team, your topic, and 
your potential methods of analysis, including an assessment of the scope of the project.   

Ideas for Data or Projects   

Many websites where people have done analysis also give the sources of their information. For 
example:   

• Nate Silver’s 538 website has many examples of analysis. One is this article by Rob Arthur 
and Jeff Asher on gun violence in Chicago. They say that they got their crime data from the 
City of Chicago open data portal https://data.cityofchicago.org/.   

• Data journalist Yue Qiu has a website with several projects reporting data on workers, trains 

carrying crude oil, and other statistics from various government websites.   

Examples of data sets used by students for the first homework:   

• Baseball hall of fame data   

• Airbnb data from Kaggle   

• Used car test data from the EPA website   

• Somerville surveys for sense of safety   

• Victim crime data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics   

• Data sets from the UPI website: faculty use of Wikipedia data, forest fires, red wine quality, 

bike rentals   

Comparing social media content with real-world events or other items.  Examples:   

• “Tweet the Debates”: Shamma et al. collected tweets associated with political debates and 

reported on tweet volume over time and social networks of people tweeting.   

• “Information Flows in Events of Political Unrest”: Nahon and Hemsley compared tweet volume 

over time with the blogosphere and news stories of events.   

• “Toward Predicting Popularity of Social Marketing Messages”: Yu et al. selected restaurants 

with the most Facebook fans in different categories and analyzed popularity of the posts based

on the number of likes and then analyzed the different types of posts by significant (most 
frequent) words.   

• Comparison of different rock bands: Authors collected tweets and Facebook posts over time, 
looking at user timelines, retweets, likes, number of comments, number of entities, and most 
frequent words from the text.   

• Analysis of tweets around an event: Collect tweets from event hashtags, showing significant 

words over time, network of people tweeting, and user locations on a map.   

Examples of student Final Projects (not all questions are reported, so these do not necessarily 
reflect the full scope of the student work, and some are multistudent):   

Data sources: EPA car review data, Edmund’s Car Reviews and Dealership Reviews.   

Questions: What are the car dealerships located in the vicinity of Syracuse, and how far away 
are they? How would you rate American-made automobiles according to mileage, horsepower, 
fuel efficiency, and cost?   

Data sources: Twitter collection from Dave Matthews Band and Phish, including the user profiles 
and the last 2,000 tweets from their user timelines.   

Question: Compare the popularity of the two bands by comparing follower and favorite counts 
from each profile, average numbers of retweets, and retweets and favorites per followers.   

Data source: Tweets collected April 18, 2016, around #parisattacks OR #bataclan with 32K 
tweets.   

Questions: What are the demographics of the tweets? Who are the most influential users (using 
SNA and retweets)? What are the demographics of the information (looking at the URLs)? What 
are the sentiments expressed in the tweets?   

Data source: Tweets about Boston Red Sox and NY Yankees, and Facebook posts and 
comments from the two teams’ Facebook fan pages.   

Questions: Updated analysis of many questions based on earlier article by Bialik in Five-
thirtyeight for 2014.   

Data sources: Airbnb data set, collected tweets about Airbnb.   

Questions: What factors influence the customer review scores? How much money can each 
host make in a particular time period? Can we use tweets about airbnb to discover recent 
popular travel trends?   

Data sources: MovieLens data set with 100K reviews and selected movie reviews downloaded 
from IMDb in HTML.

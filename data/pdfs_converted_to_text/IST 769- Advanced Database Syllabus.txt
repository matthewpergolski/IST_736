Description: 
An analysis of relational and non-relational databases and their corresponding database 
management system architectures. Learn to build complex database objects to support a variety 
of needs from both the big data and traditional perspectives. Data systems performance, 
scalability and security.  

Additional Course Description: 

This course provides tour of relational, document, key-value, columnar, and streaming database 
systems through the lens of the CAP theorem. We will explore the strengths and weaknesses of 
various database systems in the relational, Hadoop and noSQL spaces. Where possible you will 
experience these systems first-hand as to gain an understanding of how they can be used to 
address complex, big data challenges. 

Prerequisite:  IST659 

Audience:   Graduate 

Credits:  3.0 

Learning  Objectives: 
After taking this course, the students will be able to: 

1.  Demonstrate comprehension of advanced issues with the relational database model 

such as transactions, performance, and security as to understand the need for other 
database models. 

2.  Explain the CAP theorem and describe how any given database system’s archit ecture 

fits within the CAP context. 

3.  Compare different database models such as document, key-value, column-family, 

streaming, graph and relational. 

4.  Identify the most suitable database systems for a specific application’s data storage 

requirements.  

5.  Evaluate relational, Hadoop, and noSQL database tooling as to understand their 

underlying similarities and necessary differences.

A.  Class Participation. You are expected to come to class  prepared, which assumes you 

will complete the assigned readings and coursework prior to the class session.  

• 

•  All students start with 10 participation points. You only lose a point when you are 
absent, fail a participation diagnostic, or noticeably do not participate in class. 
In class we will have discussions and group activities pertinent to the coursework 
and assigned readings. Your participation will be recorded by the instructor and 
student who do not participate will be warned or notified of a point deduction. 
•  Attendance is required and there are no excused absences other than medical 
illness  documented by  the  university.  You  cannot  participate  without  being in 
attendance. 
In some classes a pop-quiz (also known as a participation diagnostic) will measure 
your study of coursework and  a  passing  grade will  count as  your participation 
grade for that week. 

• 

B.  Homework Assignments Homework assignments must be completed each week. These 
assignments  are  technical  activities  which  enforce  asynchronous  concepts  through 
practice.   Homework must be completed before the week’s class  so that  students are 
prepared to discuss the outcomes of the assignment and ask questions about it. Students 
will be assigned a grade of: 

•  High Pass (3 points) the assignment is complete and correct with no errors,  
•  Pass  (2 points) the assignment is complete on time and mostly correct with 1-2 

errors,  

•  Low pass (1 point) the assignment is incomplete or has 3 or more errors, or  not on 

time   

•  Fail (0 points) the assignment was not turned in by the due date.   

C.  Exams. This course has a mid-term and final exam, which will be issued in class. Both 
exams will cover coursework completed up to the date of the exam. The exam format is a 
mix of multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions. Examinations are closed -book, 
individual assessments and students will be given approximately 60 minutes to complete 
the exam. Students must take the exam on the assigned date and there are no make -ups.

D.  Research Paper and Slide Deck. This individual culminating assignment is your chance 
to demonstrate you can apply the principles learned in the course with in a new context. 
You  will  be  required to  research a  database  system  of your choosing, then critically 
evaluate the system based on the following defined criteria: 1. Key features 2. Storage 
requirements,  3.  How  the  product  fits  within  the  CAP  theorem,  4.  Appropriate  / 
inappropriate use cases, 5. Query language used, 6. Supported data models, 7. Technical 
limitations  8.  Competing products and  9.  A  comparison  of  those competing products 
including a justification as to why they are competitors. 

•  The whitepaper. Should cover this material in depth and include in-text citations, 
and a  list of sources cited. There should be at least 3 sources used to reference 
the  product being researched, and  this  should exclude  sources for competing 
products, which would include additional references. 

•  The Slide Deck. The slide deck is a summary of your whitepaper. It should include 
slides which outline the criteria of the whitepaper. It addition, it should include a 
title slide list of references.  

Students will be evaluated based on quality and accuracy of their evaluation as it relates 
to the lessons learned in the course, quality and appropriateness of sources cited, spelling 
and grammar, coherence of writing.

Syracuse  University  Policies 
Syracuse University has a variety of other policies designed to guarantee that students live and 
study in a community respectful of their needs and those of fellow students. Some of the most 
important of these concerns: 

Diversity  and Disability  (ensuring that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities 
in a diverse, inclusive, accessible, bias-free campus community) can be found here, at 
https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/ 

Religious  Observances  Notification  and Policy (steps to follow to request 
accommodations for the observance of religious holidays) can be found here, at: 
http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm 

Orange SUccess (tools to access a variety of SU resources, including ways to communicate 
with advisors and faculty members) can be found here, at: http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-
started-2/  

Disability-Related  Accommodations: 

Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual 
respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course 
that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to 
meet with me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may 
be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) in 
this process. 

If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with ODS, please visit their 
website at http://disabilityservices.syr.edu Please call (315) 443-4498 or email 
disabilityservices@syr.edu for more detailed information.  

ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work 
with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations may require early 
planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible 
to begin this process. 

University  Attendance  Policy: 
Attendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. Students are expected 
to arrive on campus in time to attend the first meeting of all classes for which they are 

  
 
 
 
 
 
COURSE SYLLABUS

______________________________________________________________________ 
registered.  Students who do not attend classes starting with the first scheduled meeting may be 
academically withdrawn as not making progress toward degree by failure to attend. Instructors 
set course-specific policies for absences from scheduled class meetings in their syllabi.  

It is a federal requirement that students who do not attend or cease to attend a class to be 
reported at the time of determination by the faculty. Faculty should use “ESPR” and “MSPR” in 
Orange Success to alert the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Financial Aid. A grade of 
NA is posted to any student for whom the Never Attended flag is raised in Orange SUccess. 
More information regarding Orange SUccess can be found here, at: 
http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/  

Students should also review the University’s religious observance policy and make the required 
arrangements at the beginning of each semester 

Academic  Integrity Policy: 

Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university 
community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for 
academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. 
Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn abo ut course-specific 
expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy 
governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and 
assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of 
participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work 
in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. 
Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the 
course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the 
course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. SU studen ts 
are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and 
provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre -term check-in 
on MySlice. 

Discrimination  or Harassment: 

The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any 
protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex, 
gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color, veteran status, military status, 
religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, 
gender expression or perceived gender. 

Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should 
be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer. 
She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws including Titles VI, VII, 
IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, 
Inclusion, and Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244 -
1120; by email: titleix@syr.edu; or by telephone: 315-443-0211.

1.  Course Description 
The course introduces students to applied examples of data collection, processing, transformation, 
management,  and  analysis  to  provide  students  with  hands-on  introduction  to  data  science 
experience. Students will explore key concepts related to data science, including applied statistics, 
information  visualization,  text  mining  and  machine  learning.  “R”,  the  open  source  statistical 
analysis and visualization system, will be used throughout the course. R is reckoned by many to 
be the most popular choice among data analysts worldwide; having knowledge and skill with using 
it is considered a valuable and marketable job skill for most data scientists. 

1.1. Course Structure 
The  class  is  a  combination  of  asynchronous  material  (e.g.,  pre-recorded  discussions)  and  live 
sessions. Specifically, each week will have pre-recorded video material - lectures, roundtables and 
coding demonstrations. The assigned chapters from the textbook should be read prior to reviewing 
the pre-recorded video material. 

Each  week,  you  will  have  a  chance  to  practice  and  apply  your  knowledge  via  a  homework 
assignment and in in-class lab assignment. In addition, each week, you will also submit lecture 

 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
2 

notes  and  questions  that  have  come  up  during  the  week.  All  lab  sections  will  be  live  (check 
blackboard for the details for your lab session). The weekly lab synchronous sessions will review 
key concepts, let you practice R coding and will also review any student questions that have arisen 
during the week. 

Beyond the homework and lab assignment, there will also be a large project that is part of  this 
course. This project will allow you to apply what you have learnt within the class to a real-world 
data problem, where your task is to understand the domain and the data available to determine how 
to best provide insight and wisdom from all the data that might be available. 

Finally, there will also be an exam that will include questions about the pre-recorded material and 
will also include  R-coding questions. 

1.2. Learning Objectives  
At the end of the course, students are expected to understand: 

▪  Essential concepts and characteristics of data  
▪  Scripting/code development for data management using R and R-Studio  
▪  Principles and practices in data screening, cleaning, and linking 
▪  Communication of results to decision makers 

At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to: 

▪ 
Identify a problem and the data needed for addressing the problem 
▪  Perform basic computational scripting using R and other optional tools  
▪  Transform data through processing, linking, aggregation, summarization, and searching 
▪  Organize and manage data at various stages of a project lifecycle 
▪  Determine appropriate techniques for analyzing data 

1.3. What does it take to succeed in the course? 

●  An interest and passion in data science - in the corporate, academic, or government sector 
●  Curiosity about business, science, education, health or another substantive area 
●  Essential computer skills particularly around spreadsheets 
●  Close familiarity with algebra, geometry, and trigonometry 
●  Basic understanding of simple descriptive statistics  
●  Motivation to learn and achieve a high degree of professional preparation  

2.  Textbooks:  
The primary textbook for this class is Introduction to Data Science (2017), by Jeffrey S. Saltz and 
Jeffrey M. Stanton (ISBN: 978-1506377537).  The book is available in in paperback and electronic 
version on Amazon.com: 

https://amazon.com/Introduction-Data-Science-Jeffrey-Saltz/dp/150637753X/  

As  needed,  additional  and  supplemental  readings  will  be  provided  in  the  LMS  as  electronic 
documents for downloading and printing. Students are expected to read the assigned materials for 
discussions and coursework.

3.  Contributions to Grade 
The work for this class will involve the following: 

•  Homework (22%) - The 11 homework assignments (each worth 3 points) are designed for 
you  to  practice  the  necessary  skills  in  carrying  out  data  processing,  analysis,  and 
management tasks. The code you create for the homework assignments will be instrumental 
in helping you to complete the exam successfully. 

•  Lecture Notes (12%) - While you review the 12 asynchronous Module material, you must 
take written notes on what you learn. At the end of each module you will submit a copy of 
your written notes on Blackboard. You will receive one point for each set of notes you 
below.

•  Lab Assignment (11%) - While you are in lab, you will work on an in-class assignment. 
At the end of each lab session you will submit a copy of your work (R code) on Blackboard. 
You will receive one point for your submission, as long as you have given a reasonable 
effort (i.e., it is OK if the code was not perfect – the lab section is where you are trying to 
learn the R coding concepts). 

•  Attendance Class Participation (5%) – Did you actively participate in your lab session? 
This is a course composed of content that you will consume weekly in an asynchronous 
fashion and weekly face-to-face live class sessions. Your active and constructive 
involvement with the asynchronous content and live class sessions will help to ensure 
that you receive the most benefit from this class. In other words, active participation is 
important. Like the professional environment, it is expected that you will be in class 
every week and that you will consistently appear on time. You are expected to ask 
questions and seek clarification when something in unclear to you. Your participation 
grade (5% of final grade) is based on the following elements over the 11 weeks: 

1.  Attendance in the live sessions. 
2.  Active participation in the live sessions by contributing content, asking questions, 
and taking part in the group breakouts. Participation can be in the chat box or 
verbally. 

3.  This includes the homework presentation within the lab section. 

Your instructor recognizes that your participation may vary week to week and that 
sometimes life circumstances can interfere. Therefore, the grade is based on your 
participation over the semester. 

•  Exam (25%) – The exam takes place during your lab session. It will be designed to take 
90 minutes to complete. The exam will be open-book and open-notes, but you  may not 
discuss  the  exam  with  other  students.    You  will  need  your  laptop  and  R/R-Studio  to 
complete the exam. 

•  Final project (25%) – Predictive Analytics effort. Will be done during the last half of the 

course. More information will be made available during the course.

4.  Code Template for Homework 
All homework assignments are  “.R” files (source code for R) that you will prepare in RStudio. 
Assignments must be submitted electronically to Blackboard. No hand-written assignments will 
be accepted. All R code must be commented according to the standards described by the instructor. 
All homework assignments should begin with the following code template:

# Set working directory - Change to the folder containing your homework data files 
setwd("~/Desktop/IST687/Homework")  

5.  The Large Class 
The large class will not meet on Thursdays. However, you do need to continue to block that time on your 
calendar. That time will be used, for example, for meeting (online) with your lab instructor outside of the 
lab time (with your team). In addition, part of that time will be for your lab instructor’s office hours (this 
will ensure everyone will be available during office hours, if needed). 

6.  Lecture Notes 
Lecture notes must be submitted for each module. Besides serving as evidence that you reviewed 
the pre-recorded material, the notes that you take will help you complete the exam successfully. 
Here is a rubric documenting the key components of an acceptable submission of lecture notes: 

1.  Each  module  of  pre-recorded  material  matches  with  the  chapter  or  chapters  that  were 
assigned from the book. Your notes must contain at least one summary statement for each 
assigned  book  chapter.  Summary  statements  for  a  chapter  should  mention  and  describe 
each major section of the chapter. 

2.  Each module of pre-recorded material contains several different videos: Your notes must 

have at least one summary statement for each video. 

3.  Some of the videos, particularly the ones labeled as “lecture,” contain a slide with one or 
more written questions. Your notes must contain an answer to these questions (it is OK if 
your answer is not correct, as long as you explain your answer). 

4.  Each week of pre-recorded material contains at least one video pertaining to coding with 
R/R-Studio. Your notes should contain at least one R command and an explanation of what 
it does. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
5 

5.  Any questions you have, with respect to the content, should be put into the discussion on 
that module (within blackboard). The answers to these questions will be provided in lab 
(or via blackboard). 

The criteria described above are minimal – that is they are the minimum requirements needed to 
earn the credit for the module notes submission. Your learning process and your performance on 
the exams will be better served by taking more extensive notes. 

7.  Lab Sessions 
During  most  lab  sessions,  you  will  work  on  a  lab  coding  assignment,  typically  with  one  other 
person. No specific pre-work is required for the lab coding assignment – but you need to come to 
class prepared (i.e., will likely need to use your text book, R code examples and lecture notes). 

In  addition,  several  times  during  the  semester,  as  part  of  a  team,  you  will  provide  a  short 
presentation describing the solution for the assigned homework. For example, during week 3 class 
on Sept 10th, a team will present the homework solution for week 2. The team will need to meet 
with  the  lab  instructor  prior  to  that  lab  session  (either  during  the  large  lecture  time  or  another 
agreed  upon  time).  For  each  presentation,  another  team  will  be  responsible  to  evaluate  the 
presentation of the team and a third team will be accountable to ask at least two questions relating 
to the presentation. These presentations will be a key aspect of your participation grade.

Your work is outstanding 

Your work is about what would be expected of a 
serious student 

Your  work  falls  below  what  is  expected  but  is 
adequate 

Your work is out of the picture 

3.  It  is  unethical  to  allow  some  students  additional  opportunities,  such  as  extra  credit 

assignments, without allowing the same options to all students. 

4.  Students who wish to dispute a grade may resubmit the assignment for regrading with a 
one-page  statement  of  explanation  of  why  the  paper  should  be  regraded.  If  the  student 
resubmits, the assignment will be regraded, which means the grade may go up, down, or 
stay  the  same.  Except  for  extraordinary  circumstances,  no  appeal  for  an  individual 
assignment or project will be  considered later than  two weeks after  the  assignment was 
graded.  

10. SPECIAL NOTICES RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, norms for the conduct of classes and for student classroom 
behavior are necessarily different than in the past.  

Stay Safe Pledge 
Syracuse University’s Stay Safe Pledge reflects the high value that we, as a university 
community, place on the well-being of our community members. This pledge defines norms for 
behavior that will promote community health and wellbeing. Classroom expectations include the 
following: wearing a mask that covers the nose and mouth at all times, maintaining a distance of 
six feet from others, and staying away from class if you feel unwell. Students who do not follow 
these norms will not be allowed to continue in face-to-face classes; repeated violations will be 
treated as violations of the Code of Student Conduct and may result in disciplinary action. 

Food and Drink in the Classroom 
Eating and drinking require the lowering of the face mask, creating a potentially dangerous 
situation. For this reason, students are not allowed to eat or drink in class during the COVID-19 
pandemic.   

Online Etiquette 
Students participating remotely in hybrid class sessions are participating on an equal basis as the 
students who are in the classroom. It is reasonable to expect online students to have their 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 

webcam on and to call on them as you would call on students who are in the room. Online 
students should dress and behave as they would in a face-to-face class.  

Attendance 
The university’s Stay Safe Pledge requires students to stay away from in-person classes when 
they feel unwell. Therefore, as needed, students can join remotely for their lab section, even if it 
is “their turn” to physically attend the lab session.  

11. University and School Policies 
Academic Integrity 
The  academic  community  of  Syracuse  University  and  of  the  School  of  Information  Studies 
requires the highest standards of professional ethics and personal integrity from all members of 
the community. Violations of these standards are violations of a mutual obligation characterized 
by  trust,  honesty,  and  personal  honor.  As  a  community,  we  commit  ourselves  to  standards  of 
academic  conduct,  impose  sanctions  against  those  who  violate  these  standards,  and  keep 
appropriate records of violations.   

Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university 
community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic 
honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should 
understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about 
university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use 
of  sources,  the  integrity  of  work  submitted  in  exams  and  assignments,  and  the  veracity  of 
signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy 
also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving 
written  authorization  in  advance  from  both  instructors.  Under  the  policy,  students  found  in 
violation  are  subject  to  grade  sanctions  determined  by  the  course  instructor  and  non-grade 
sanctions  determined  by  the  School  or  College  where  the  course  is  offered  as  described  in  the 
Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. Syracuse University students are required to read an 
online  summary  of  the  University’s  academic  integrity  expectations  and  provide  an  electronic 
signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check- in on MySlice.   

Course evaluations 
At the end of the term, the iSchool will ask you to share course feedback through EvaluationKIT 
[https://coursefeedback.syr.edu]. Log in to EvaluationKIT using your NetID and password. Please 
take the time to share your feedback about this course and your experience in it; all ratings and 
comments  are  completely  anonymous. The  iSchool  carefully  reviews  your  feedback.  Our 
instructors use this feedback to fine tune course delivery and instruction; our professors of record 
use this feedback to fine tune course content and assignments. All feedback is factored into iSchool 
decisions about course, program and instructor development.  

Faith-based Observances 
Syracuse  University  recognizes  the  diverse  faith  traditions  represented  among  its  campus 
community and supports the rights of faculty, staff, and students to observe according to these. 
This link http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm provides a description of SU’s 
religious observance policy. Under this policy, students are provided an opportunity to make up 
examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to religious observance provided 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 

they  notify  the  university  and  their  instructors  before  the  end  of  the  second  week  of  classes. 
Students will have access to an online notification system for this purpose on MySlice during the 
first two weeks of the semester. The make up of an activity affected by a religious observance will 
be  scheduled  to  be  completed  within  a  week  of  the  missed  deadline  in  agreement  with  the 
instructor. 

Disabilities 
If  you  believe  that  you  need  accommodations  for  a  disability,  please  contact  the  Office  of 
Disability  Services  (ODS),  http://disabilityservices.syr.edu,  located  in  Room  309  of  804 
University  Avenue,  or  call  (315)  443-4498  for  an  appointment  to  discuss  your  needs  and  the 
process  for  requesting  accommodations.  ODS  is  responsible  for  coordinating  disability-related 
accommodations  and  will  issue  students  with  documented  disabilities  Accommodation 
Authorization  Letters,  as  appropriate.  Since  accommodations  may  require  early  planning  and 
generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible. 

Ownership of Student Work 
This  course  may  use  course  participation  and  documents  created  by  students  for  educational 
purposes. In compliance with the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, works in all 
media produced by students as part of their course  participation at  Syracuse University may be 
used for educational purposes, provided that the course syllabus makes clear that such use may 
occur. It is understood that registration for and continued enrollment in a course where such use 
of student works is announced constitutes permission by the student. After such a course has been 
completed,  any  further  use  of  student  works  will  meet  one  of  the  following  conditions:  (1)  the 
work will be rendered anonymous through the removal of all personal identification of the work’s 
creator/originator(s);  or  (2)  the  creator/originator(s)’  written  permission  will  be  secured.  As 
generally  accepted  practice,  honors  theses,  graduate  theses,  graduate  research  projects, 
dissertations,  or  other  exit  projects  submitted  in  partial  fulfillment  of  degree  requirements  are 
placed in the library, University Archives, or academic departments for public reference.

Catalog Description: 

Linguistic and computational aspect of natural language processing technologies. Lectures, 
readings, and projects in the computational techniques required to perform all levels of 
linguistic processing of text. Additional work required of graduate students. 

Important Note:   
This section of IST664/CIS668 will offer a pilot test of a new textbook, Natural Language 
Processing in Action (Manning Publications, 2019) by Kane, Howard, and Hapke. Please preview 
this textbook before registering for this section. 

Overview: 

With the growth of the internet over the past 25 years, the world is awash with text written by 
people. Text created by humans is commonly called “natural language” – this term 
encompasses the broad diversity in the forms, styles, dialects, vocabularies, and even character 
sets used. Natural language processing is therefore the art and science of using computers and 
software to ingest, filter, organize, and analyze naturally occurring texts. This course is designed 
to develop an understanding of how Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques work to 
process text for various practical and research applications. This goal will be achieved by: 
•  Readings, lectures, and class discussions of the multiple levels of linguistic analysis 

required for a computer to accept natural language input, transform it, interpret it, and 
carry out a particular application; 

•  Lab exercises and assignments in using computational techniques required to perform 

these levels of natural language processing of text, and,  

•  Examinations of real-world applications that incorporate substantive NLP modules. 

We will examine and discuss the techniques of NLP at the various levels of linguistic analysis, 
going through tokenization, word-level semantics, Part-Of-Speech tagging, syntax, semantics 
and on up to the discourse level. The course will also include consideration of the use of NLP 
techniques in practical applications. These will include Information Retrieval, Question 
Answering, Sentiment Analysis, Summarization and Dialogue Systems. 

Note that natural language processing shares concepts and techniques with the area of data 
science known as text mining, but also has distinctive origins, emphases, concepts, and

techniques. While we will sometimes make connections with text mining, but IST664 is not a 
course in text mining.

Prerequisite / Co-requisite:  

None. The course uses the programming language Python, primarily in the Jupyter Notebook 
environment, but does not require any previous experience with programming languages. 

Audience:  

The course is intended primarily for M.S. students in Information Management, Computer 
Science, Computational Journalism, or Linguistics, though it may be of interest and value to 
students in other programs. 

Credits: 

3 credits 

Learning Objectives: 

At the end of the course the student will be able to 

1.  Define and describe the various levels of linguistic analysis,  

2.  Define and demonstrate the computational techniques used to understand text at each 

linguistic level and what the challenges are for those techniques 

3.  Process text through the various language levels using the resources of the Natural 

Language Toolkit (NLTK)  

4.  Learn essential uses of the programming language Python in the Jupyter notebook 

environment 

5.  Describe how NLP is used in many types of real-world applications.

Additional supplementary readings will be available on Blackboard. 

Course Requirements and Expectations: 

•  Gutenberg Text Processing Assignments (50%) [learning objectives 1-4] 
There will be five individual text processing assignments during weeks 2 – 10 of the course. 
For each assignment, you will use as input one of the plain text books in the list at the end 
of this syllabus. Each student will produce results using their own Project Gutenberg book 
(i.e., no two students may use the same book). The tasks will be of increasing difficulty. 

In-Class Midterm Exam (20%) [learning objectives 1, 2, and 4] 

• 
The class session for Week 7 will have a closed book, closed laptop, in-person, paper-based 
midterm exam focusing on NLP concepts. The exam will contain some small code snippets 
but will not require any coding as such. 

•  NLP Tutorial Jupyter Notebook (25%) [learning objectives 1-5] 
You will choose a specific NLP topic to explore, and present it in the form of a free-standing 
tutorial as a publicly available Jupyter notebook. Your tutorial will consist of an extensive 
amount of explanatory text interspersed with small snippets of working code. The best of 
these tutorials will become part of a library of resources (with full attribution of your 
authorship) for future Syracuse University students (and others as well). When you submit 
your tutorial, please also submit the Turnitin test record of your tutorial’s content. You can 
find instruction on how to do so from here: 
https://researchguides.library.syr.edu/ld.php?content_id=40765513. 

The evaluation of the tutorial includes three aspects: the tutorial content, the quality of the 
code and the overall usability, usefulness, and originality.  

a). The tutorial content needs to include these five sections: 

1) Your name as the original author 
2) A 250-word introduction to the tutorial, related important definitions, etc. 
3) The code snippets interspersed with explanations 
4) Conclusion, including suggestions for additional readings and resources 
5) Bibliography including all code/text sources consulted in creating the tutorial 

b). The code in your tutorial will be evaluated based on: 

1) That the code actually works and does not throw any errors 
2) Your familiarity and facility with the topics your code demonstrates; 
3) The quality of the code including comments and stylistic considerations 

  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
GRADUATE COURSE SYLLABUS 
 Natural Language Processing, IST664 (CIS668) 
Wednesdays – 9:30 AM to 12:15 PM 

c). The usability, usefulness, and originality of your tutorial will be evaluated based on the 
value of the topic and the explanations to other NLP learners, the overall quality of the 
tutorial, including grammatically correct, conceptually correct, and understandable 
explanations, and importantly, that it does not duplicate another available resource.  

4 

Below is a list of the areas and topics that you may be interested in exploring. Or, you may 
propose another area of interest to you. Remember the importance of originality – your 
own learning (and that of others who use your tutorial) will be greatly enhanced by 
choosing a topic that does not already have a useable tutorial online.  

•  Machine Translation Challenges Related to Specific Language Pairs 
•  Detection of Particular Classes of Content (e.g., offensive speech, propaganda, 

misinformation) 

•  Content Moderation Issues and Challenges 
•  Evaluation Metrics (existing or emerging methods for quantifying the performance 

quality of an NLP technique) 

•  Language Generation including Chatbots 
•  Enabling resource production for “Low Resource” languages (e.g., bilingual 

dictionary induction) 

•  Natural Language Understanding 
•  Automatic Summarization 
•  Question/Answering Systems 
• 
•  New Approaches to Classic Problems in NLP: Polysemy, Sarcasm, Humor  

Image to Text 

•  Professionality (10%) 

As a Syracuse University graduate, we expect you to uphold the highest standards of 
professionality including honesty, integrity, respectful communications, lifelong 
commitment to learning, supporting others, punctuality, and appreciation of the diverse 
talents and capabilities of colleagues and coworkers. Active participation in the class is 
expected, particularly with respect to answering questions that the professor addresses 
to the class. The professor judges a student’s class participation based on the following 
guidelines: 

o  Arriving on time to class and prepared to do your best work when class begins 
o  Attentiveness to the course content; reading the assigned readings for each 

week prior to coming to class and be ready to discuss them in class.  

o  Active participation in the small group discussions/activities in the class. This 
means not only offering information, but also listening to others and working 
constructively with them  

o  Respectful communication with your peers and the instructor

Grading: 

Grades are assigned based on the quality of the work. The instructor’s professional judgments 
of all submitted work are final. Work submitted after the deadlines shown in Blackboard will 
only be accepted at the discretion of the instructor and will be subject to a late penalty. Work 
should not be submitted to the instructor by email. If you upload the wrong file to Blackboard, 
ask your instructor to reset the attempt. Erroneous uploads are not a valid excuse for late 
submission of work, so plan ahead and don’t wait to submit until the last moment. Here’s a 
grading table to translate points to final letter grade: 

A = 95-100; A- = 90-94.99; B+ = 85-89.99; B = 80-84.99; B- = 75-79.99

University Attendance Policy 

Attendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. Students are expected to 
arrive on campus in time to attend the first meeting of all classes for which they are registered. 
Students  who  do  not  attend  classes  starting  with  the  first  scheduled  meeting  may  be 
academically withdrawn as not making progress toward degree by failure to attend. Instructors 
set course-specific policies for absences from scheduled class meetings in their syllabi.  

It is a federal requirement that students who do not attend or cease to attend a class to be 
reported at the time of determination by the faculty. Faculty should use “ESPR” and “MSPR” in 
Orange Success to alert the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Financial Aid. A grade of NA 
is posted to any student for whom the Never Attended flag is raised in Orange SUccess. More 
information regarding Orange SUccess can be found here, at: 
http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/  
Students should also review the University’s religious observance policy and make the required 
arrangements at the beginning of each semester 

Specific Course Policies 

•  Many of the work products for this course are in the form of Jupyter notebooks. We will 
generally work on these in Google’s “colab” environment. When you submit a Jupyter 
notebook assignment you should download the ipynb file from colab and submit it. Note 
the importance of originality and citation: Any work that was produced by others (such 
as code fragments that appear online) should have an accompanying source citation. 
Anything you submit that does not have a citation will be attributed to you – which 
means that you will be held responsible for plagiarism if the work you submit as your 
own is not original. 

•  There will be NO make-up exam for the midterm. You should plan your semester 

carefully to avoid being absent for the Week 7 class. 

•  A student who misses classes will lose professionalism points. For each absent class, the 

• 

student will lose five points. 
Integrity is a crucial element of being a data scientist or information professional. You 
may consult the Internet for code examples to help you with your homework or 
projects. You MUST give credit whenever you reuse someone else’s code. A code block 
that contains someone else’s code should contain as comment that names the author of 
the code and another comment containing the URL where the code was found.  

Syracuse University Policies:  

  
 
 
 
 
 
GRADUATE COURSE SYLLABUS 
 Natural Language Processing, IST664 (CIS668) 
Wednesdays – 9:30 AM to 12:15 PM 

Syracuse University has a variety of other policies designed to guarantee that students live and 
study in a community respectful of their needs and those of fellow students. Some of the most 
important of these concerns:  

8 

Diversity and Disability (ensuring that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities 
in a diverse, inclusive, accessible, bias-free campus community) can be found here, at 
https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/ 

Religious Observances Notification and Policy (steps to follow to request 
accommodations for the observance of religious holidays) can be found here, at: 
http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm 

Orange SUccess (tools to access a variety of SU resources, including ways to communicate 
with advisors and faculty members) can be found here, at:  
http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/ 

Disability-Related Accommodations: 

Syracuse  University  values  diversity  and  inclusion;  we  are  committed  to  a  climate  of  mutual 
respect and full participation. There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course 
that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I invite any student to 
meet with me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be 
essential to your success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) in this 
process. 

If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with ODS, please visit their 
website at http://disabilityservices.syr.edu./ Please call (315) 443-4498 or email 
disabilityservices@syr.edu for more detailed information.  

ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work 
with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations may require early 
planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible to 
begin this process. 

Academic Integrity Policy: 

Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university 
community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for 
academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. 
Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific 
expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy 
governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and 
assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
GRADUATE COURSE SYLLABUS 
 Natural Language Processing, IST664 (CIS668) 
Wednesdays – 9:30 AM to 12:15 PM 

participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same 
work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both 
instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions 
determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or 
College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification 
Rubric. SU students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic 
integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a 
year during pre-term check-in on MySlice. 

9 

Note: In this course, all group members are expected to participate actively and make sure that 
no plagiarism or other violations of the Academic Integrity occurs in the group reports. 
If I suspect any type of plagiarism or cheating, I will consult with the academic integrity panel. 

Educational Use of Student Work 
Student work prepared for University courses in any media may be used for educational 
purposes, if the course syllabus makes clear that such use may occur. You grant permission to 
have your work used in this manner by registering for, and by continuing to be enrolled in, 
courses where such use of student work is announced in the course syllabus.  

I intend to use academic work that you complete this semester for educational purposes in this 
course during this semester. Your registration and continued enrollment constitute your 
permission. 

I intend to use academic work that you complete this semester in subsequent semesters for 
educational purposes. Before using your work for that purpose, I will either get your written 
permission or render the work anonymous by removing all your personal identification. 

As a generally accepted practice, honors theses, graduate theses, graduate research projects, 
dissertations, or other capstone projects submitted in partial fulfillment of degree requirements 
are placed in the library, University Archives, or department for public reference. 

Discrimination or Harassment  

The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or discrimination related to any 
protected category including creed, ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, 
sex, gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color, veteran status, military 
status, religion, sexual orientation, domestic violence status, genetic information, gender 
identity, gender expression or perceived gender. 

Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these protected bases should 
be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the University’s Chief Equal Opportunity & Title IX Officer. 
She is responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws including Titles VI, VII, 

  
 
 
 
GRADUATE COURSE SYLLABUS 
 Natural Language Processing, IST664 (CIS668)

IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, 
Inclusion, and Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244-
1120; by email: titleix@syr.edu; or by telephone: 315-443-0211. 

Federal and state law, and University policy prohibit discrimination and harassment based on 
sex or gender (including sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic/dating violence, stalking, 
sexual exploitation, and retaliation).  

If a student has been harassed or assaulted, they can obtain confidential counseling support, 
24-hours a day, 7 days a week, from the Sexual and Relationship Violence Response Team at 
the Counseling Center (315-443-4715, 200 Walnut Place, Syracuse, New York 13244-5040). 
Incidents of sexual violence or harassment can be reported non-confidentially to the 
University’s Title IX Officer (Sheila Johnson Willis, 315-443-0211, titleix@syr.edu, 005 Steele 
Hall). Reports to law enforcement can be made to the University’s Department of Public Safety 
(315-443-2224, 005 Sims Hall), the Syracuse Police Department (511 South State Street, 
Syracuse, New York, 911 in case of emergency or 315-435-3016 to speak with the Abused 
Persons Unit), or the State Police (844-845-7269).  

I will seek to keep information you share with me private to the greatest extent possible, but as 
a professor I have mandatory reporting responsibilities to share information regarding sexual 
misconduct, harassment, and crimes I learn about to help make our campus a safer place for all. 

Course evaluations:  
There will be an end of course evaluation for you to complete this term. This evaluation will be 
conducted online and is entirely anonymous. You will receive an official notification in your 
email account with the evaluation website link and your passcode. Please take the time and fill 
out this evaluation as your feedback and support of this assessment effort is very much 
appreciated. The school carefully reviews ratings and comments that you submit, and these 
factor into decisions about course, program and instructor development.
